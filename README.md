Q: Why is my screen white or black?

A: Its because you probally deleted browser-gui directory. (even though it should display an error)

EXTRA: Download this repo . rename the repo folder "HadiWebBrowser-GUI" to "browser-gui", now move it to the directory HadiWebBrowser.exe it should work now. 

Q: Why dont the buttons work!!! (except light/dark switch)

A: Because this webpage (index.html) only works on HadiWebBrowser as that defines a browser_native js object.
